# Image-compression-using-MATLAB
SVD is used in MATLAB for image compression



Instructions :

1) Open the file in MatLab and also place the image in the current working directory.
2)Enter the name of the file you wish to compress (Note :All outputs are in jpeg format)
3)With increasing size of the file , the compression takes longer ..
4) We will be generating 4 different compression files , based on the total number of total
  number of terms in the final compressed image (Principal Component Analysis)
  The total-terms in the final image are 2,5,10,50

5) For larger image files , the output takes slightly longer
6)Voila !. You have a compressed jpeg file
